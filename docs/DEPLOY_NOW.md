All code is complete and tested. Follow these steps to deploy:

---

## Option 1: Vercel CLI (Fastest)

```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

### 4. Deploy to Production

```

### 5. Set Environment Variable (Optional)

```
Paste your OpenRouter API key when prompted.

**Note**: App works without API key using canned responses.

---

## Option 2: GitHub + Vercel Dashboard

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Emotion Detective Academy"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin [your-github-repo-url]
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Deploy via Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
2. Click "Import Project"
3. Select your GitHub repository
4. Vercel auto-detects Next.js and Python
5. Click "Deploy"

### 3. Add Environment Variable (Optional)
1. Go to project settings
2. Navigate to "Environment Variables"
3. Add `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` with your key

---

## After Deployment

### 1. Get Your Live URL
Vercel will provide a URL like: `https://emotion-detective-academy.vercel.app`

### 2. Test the Deployment
```bash
# Test API
curl https://your-app.vercel.app/api/session/start \
  -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"mystery_id": "playground_lonely"}'

# Should return JSON with session_id
```

### 3. Update README
Add your live URL to `README.md`:
```markdown
## üåê Live Demo
Visit: https://your-app.vercel.app
```

### 4. Test Full Flow
1. Visit your live URL
2. Click "Start Investigation"
3. Talk to Swing, Slide, Tree
4. Collect 3 clues
5. Submit solution
6. View celebration
7. Check parent dashboard at `/parent/[session-id]`

---

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment Failed?
- Check `vercel.json` is present
- Ensure `requirements.txt` and `package.json` are valid
- Review build logs in Vercel dashboard

### API Returns 404?
- Verify `vercel.json` routes configuration
- Check that `api/index.py` exists
- Review function logs in Vercel dashboard

### Cold Start Timeout?
- First request may take 2-5 seconds
- This is normal for serverless functions
- Subsequent requests are faster
