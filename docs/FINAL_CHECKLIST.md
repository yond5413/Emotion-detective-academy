## Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails
1. Check `vercel.json` syntax
2. Verify `requirements.txt` is valid
3. Ensure `package.json` is correct
4. Review build logs in Vercel dashboard

### If API Returns 404
1. Verify routes in `vercel.json`
2. Check `api/index.py` exists
3. Test locally with `vercel dev`

### If Cold Start is Slow
1. This is normal (2-5 seconds)
2. Add loading states (already done)
3. Consider keeping function warm (optional)
