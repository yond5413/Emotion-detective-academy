## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Single Vercel Deployment**: Frontend + Backend in one repo
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router) + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python serverless) + Mangum adapter
- **AI**: OpenRouter with 3-model rotation (DeepSeek R1, GPT-OSS-20B, Mistral Small)

## 🤖 AI Agent Design

### Character Personalities

**Swing**
- Backstory: Used to be popular, now feels forgotten
- Emotional arc: Sad → Hopeful → Happy
- Language: Simple, expressing loneliness

**Slide**
- Backstory: New to playground, didn't realize Swing felt left out
- Emotional arc: Worried → Relieved → Happy
- Language: Confident but concerned

**Tree**
- Backstory: Old observer who's seen many seasons
- Emotional arc: Concerned → Proud → Content
- Language: Wise, calm, understanding

### System Prompts
Each character has:
- Personality traits (3-4 key traits)
- Backstory context
- Current emotional state
- Response guidelines (2-3 sentences, simple words)
- Age-appropriateness rules (5-9 years)

### Model Rotation
1. Try `deepseek/deepseek-r1:free`
2. Fallback to `openai/gpt-oss-20b:free`
3. Fallback to `mistralai/mistral-small-3.2-24b-instruct:free`
4. Final fallback to canned response

## 📊 Parent Dashboard Insights

### Session Summary
- Duration in minutes
- Mystery completion status
- Number of questions asked
- Child's proposed solution

### Emotion Words Learned
- Visual badges for each emotion word
- Tracks: lonely, sad, worried, happy, excited, grateful, forgotten

### Empathy Moments
- Tracks perspective-taking questions
- Keywords: why, feel, how, understand, help
- Shows actual questions child asked

### Conversation Starters
